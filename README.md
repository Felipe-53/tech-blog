## About

Personal web site and blog. I write about Full Stack development with JavaScript, TypeScript and all the amazing technologies bornt within this ecosystem. Still very much a work in progress. [Check it out!](https://www.example.com)

## Stack

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS

## Chores

- Hook a database up instead of comitting articles to the project repo. Reason: separation of concerns. Content should be separate from code. A good candidate for database is Firebase Firestore. Serverless and cost efficient.
